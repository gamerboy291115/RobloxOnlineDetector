Roblox Online Detector is an open-source GitHub repository that shows you how to install and set up this tool. This script allows you to choose any profile on the Roblox platform, and it will notify you with a loud warning sound when that player is online. If the player is offline, it will indicate that as well. Ever wanted to join one of your favorite Roblox YouTubers, but when you visit their Roblox profile, you never seem to catch them online? With this tool, you can run it in the background while playing games, or simply let it run. Once the Roblox player you chose is online, it will notify you with a loud sound.
